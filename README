Building
---------

PgBouncer uses libevent for low-level socket handling.
Libevent needs to be at least version 1.3b.

When this is installed just run:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libevent=/prefix
	$ make
	$ make install

If the OS does not have libevent available as package, it can be
downloaded from http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

Building from CVS
-----------------

Building PgBouncer from CVS requires that you generate the header
and config files before you can run configure:

	$ make boot
	$ ./configure ...
	$ make

To have manpages, asciidoc 8.x and xmlto need to be installed,
as CVS does not contain generated pages.  Without those,
manpages are skipped when building/installing.

Building for WIN32
------------------

At the moment only build env tested is MINGW32 / MSYS.  Cygwin
and Visual $ANYTHING are untested.

Then do the usual:

	$ ./configure ...
	$ make

If cross-compiling from Unix:

	$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc ...

Running on WIN32
----------------

Running from command-line goes as usual, except -d (daemonize),
-R (reboot) and -u (switch user) switches will not work.

To run pgbouncer as a service, you need to configure
`service_name` parameter to set name for service.  Then:

	$ pgbouncer -regservice config.ini

To uninstall service:

	$ pgbouncer -unregservice config.ini

To use Windows Event Log, set "syslog = 1" in config file.
But before you need to register pgbevent.dll:

	$ regsvr32 pgbevent.dll

To unregister it, do `regsvr32 /u pgbevent.dll`.
