Building
---------

PgBouncer uses libevent for low-level socket handling.  When this is
installed just run:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libevent=/prefix
	$ make
	$ make install

If the OS does not have libevent available as package, it can be
downloaded from http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
