Building
---------

PgBouncer uses libevent for low-level socket handling.  When this is
installed just run:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libevent=/prefix
	$ make
	$ make install

If the OS does not have libevent available as package, it can be
downloaded from http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

Building from CVS
-----------------

Building PgBouncer from CVS requires that you generate the header
and config files before you can run configure:

	$ make boot
	$ ./configure ...
	$ make

To have manpages, asciidoc 8.x and xmlto need to be installed,
as CVS does not contain generated pages.  Without those,
manpages are skipped when building/installing.
