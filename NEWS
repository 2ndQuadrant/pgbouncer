2007-04-12  -  PgBouncer 1.0.6  -  "Daily Dose"

  * The "Disable maintenance during the takeover" fix could
    disable maintenance altogether.  Fix it.
  * Compilation fix for FreeBSD, <sys/ucred.h> requires <sys/param.h> there.
    Thanks go to Robert Gogolok for report.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.5  -  "Enough for today"

  * Fix online-restart bugs:
    - Set ->ready for idle servers.
    - Remove obsolete code from use_client_socket()
    - Disable maintenance during the takeover.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.4  -  "Last 'last' bug"

  * Notice from idle server tagged server dirty.
    release_server() did not expect it.  Fix it
    by dropping them.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.3  -  "Fearless Fork"

  = Fixes =

  * Some error handling was missing in login path, so dying
    connection there could trigger asserts.
  * Cleanup of asserts in sbuf.c to catch problems earlier.
  * Create core when Assert() triggers.

  = New stuff =

  * New config vars: log_connections, log_disconnections,
    log_pooler_errors to turn on/off noise.
  * Config var: client_login_timeout to kill dead connections
    in login phase that could stall SUSPEND and thus online restart.

2007-03-28  -  PgBouncer 1.0.2  -  "Supersonic Spoon"

  * libevent may report a deleted event inside same loop.
    Avoid socket reuse for one loop.
  * release_server() from disconnect_client() didnt look
    it the packet was actually sent.

2007-03-15  -  PgBouncer 1.0.1  -  "Alien technology"

  = Fixes =

  * Mixed usage of cached and non-cached time, plus unsiged usec_t typedef
    created spurious query_timeout errors.
  * Fix rare case when socket woken up from send-wait could stay stalling.
  * More fair queueing of server connections.  Before, a new query could
    get a server connections before older one.
  * Delay server release until everything is guaranteed to be sent.

  = Features =

  * SHOW SOCKETS command to have detailed info about state state.
  * Put PgSocket ptr to log, to help tracking one connection.
  * In console, allow SELECT in place of SHOW.
  * Various code cleanups.
