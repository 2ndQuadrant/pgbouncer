= PgBouncer TODO list =

 * -R should detect that no pooler is running and boot normally
 * -R should detect if login fails then exit()
 * PAUSE <db>; RESUME <db>;

 * keep stats about error counts?
 * SHUTDOWN cmd should print notice?
 * before loading users, disable all existing?

 * log_connects, log_disconnects settings

 * Split CL_IDLE from CL_ACTIVE.  Does not give functional
 advantage, but makes monitoring easier.
