= PgBouncer TODO list =

== High-prority ==

 * PAUSE <db>; RESUME <db>;

== Low-prio, technically suspicious items ==

 * -R should somehow log whats happens
 * -R should detect that no pooler is running and boot normally
 * -R should detect if login fails then exit()

== Low-prio, otherwise suspicious items ==

 * keep stats about error counts
 * SHUTDOWN cmd should print notice
 * before loading users, disable all existing
 * Split CL_IDLE from CL_ACTIVE.  Does not give functional
