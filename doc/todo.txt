= PgBouncer TODO list =

== next release - 1.2 ==

 * test

== Minor features ==

 * removing user should work - kill connections
 * keep stats about error counts
 * cleanup of logging levels, to make log more useful
 * to test:
   - signal flood
   - no mem / no fds handling
 * new states for clients: idle and in-query.  That allows to apply
   client_idle_timeout and query_timeout without walking all clients
   on maintenance time.

== Dubious/complicated features ==

 * units for config parameters.
 * some preliminary notification that fd limit is full

 * Move all "look-at-full-packet" situtations to SBUF_EV_PKT_CALLBACK
 * auth_conn - access to pg_shadow, so auth_file is not needed
 * maybe libevent calls should look at errno? (esp. event_del())

=== prepared plans ===

 * keeping track of protocol-level prepared plans
   - JDBC workaround in the meantime: protocolVersion=2

=== load-balancing ===

 * allow serveral server to serve one db
   - possibility to specify failover databases.
 * seems pointless - result would be less featureful HAProxy

=== SMP awareness ===

 * spread sockets over per-cpu threads.  needs confirmation that
   single-threadedness can be problem.  it can also be that only
   accept() + login handling of short connection is problem.
   that could be solved by just having threads for login handling,
   which would be lot simpler.  or just deciding that its not
   worth fixing.
