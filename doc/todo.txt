= PgBouncer TODO list =

== Low-prio ==

 * create manpage
 * report existing pidfile to console

=== Make -R less scary ===

 * -R should somehow log whats happens
 * -R should detect that no pooler is running and boot normally
 * -R should detect if login fails then exit()

 Details:
 * Takeover before fork()
 * must not touch libevent, just fill structures,
   libevent init after fork()
 * ^C while takeover - immidiate _exit()
 * detection:
   - if tcp - try binding
   - if unix - try connect()

== Low-prio, otherwise suspicious items ==

 * keep stats about error counts
 * SHUTDOWN cmd should print notice
 * before loading users, disable all existing
 * Split CL_IDLE from CL_ACTIVE.  Does not give functional
 advantage, but makes monitoring easier.
