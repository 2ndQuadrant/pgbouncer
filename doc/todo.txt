= PgBouncer TODO list =

== Ver 1.1 ==

 * create manpage
 * drop_on_error/keep_on_error - if released conn is in error state,
 then issue rollback and keep it
 * suspend_timeout - drop stalled conns
 * rename disable_varcache to track_parameters
 * some preliminary notification that fd limit is full

== Ver 1.0.9 ==

 * Support downgrade from 1.1.

== Make -R less scary ==

 * -R should somehow log whats happens
 * -R should detect that no pooler is running and boot normally
 * -R should detect if login fails then exit()

==== Details: ====
 * Takeover before fork()
 * must not touch libevent, just fill structures,
 libevent init after fork()
 * ^C while takeover - immidiate _exit()
 * detection:
   * if tcp - try binding
   * if unix - try connect()

== Just ideas ==

 * keep stats about error counts
 * auth_conn - access to pg_shadow, so auth_file is not needed
 * units for config parameters.
 * cleanup of logging levels, to make log more useful

== Dropped ideas ==

 * possibility to specify failover databases.
 * load-balancing between different servers.
 * keeping track of prepared plans - fixed in 8.3 by DISCARD ALL;
