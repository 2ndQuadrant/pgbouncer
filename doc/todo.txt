= PgBouncer TODO list =

== Minor features ==

 * suspend_timeout - drop stalled conns
 * some preliminary notification that fd limit is full
 * drop_on_error/keep_on_error - if released conn is in error state,
 then issue rollback and keep it

 * keep stats about error counts
 * auth_conn - access to pg_shadow, so auth_file is not needed
 * units for config parameters.
 * cleanup of logging levels, to make log more useful
 * logging to syslog
