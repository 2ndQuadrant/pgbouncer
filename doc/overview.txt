Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL.

Downloads, bugtracker, CVS: http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgbouncer

== Features ==

 * Several levels of brutality when rotating connections:

  Session pooling::
	Most polite method.  When client connects, a server connection
	will be assigned to it for the whole duration it stays connected.
	When client disconnects, the server connection will be put back
	into pool.

  Transaction pooling::
	Server connection is assigned to client only during a transaction.
	When PgBouncer notices that transaction is over, the server
	will be put back into pool.

  Statement pooling::
	Most aggressive method.  The server connection will be put back into
	pool immidiately after a query completes.  Multi-statement
	transactions are disallowed in this mode as they would break.

 * Low memory requirements (2k per connection by default).  This is due
 to the fact that PgBouncer does not need to see full packet at once.

 * It is not tied to one backend server, the destination databases can
 reside on different hosts.

 * Supports online reconfiguration for most of the settings.

 * Supports online restart/upgrade - is able transfer sockets to new process.

 * Supports protocol V3 only, so backend version must be >= 7.4.
