 * A simple version of Bob Jenkins' lookup3.c hash.
 *
 * It is supposed to give same results as hashlittle() on little-endian
 * and hashbig() on big-endian machines.
 *
 * Speed seems comparable to Jenkins' optimized version (~ -10%).
 * Actual difference varies as it depends on cpu/compiler/libc details.
